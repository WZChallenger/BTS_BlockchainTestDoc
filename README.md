## Question 1
You have been given 2 unusually durable PS5â€™s. You are in an office building that is
100 stories high. Using the fewest possible number of drops from windows in your office
building, determine the highest floor you can drop a PS5 from and have it survive. For
example, they might be able to take the drop from the 30th floor, but not the 31st. You
can break both PS5s in your search. State the worst case number of drops needed and
explain how you arrived at that answer. (5 min)

  32 times

  Applied half-dividing method.<br>
  First time, I try to drop on 50th floor.

  - If the first PS5 is broken:<br>
    To keep the second PS5 as long as possible, I try to climb up from the 1st floor with the second PS5.
    So I won't try the half-dividing method (25th floor) at this moment.

  - If the first PS5 is not broken:<br>
    To keep the second PS5 as long as possible, I try to climb up from the 51st floor with the second PS5.
    So I won't try the half-dividing method (25th floor) at this moment.

Absolutely the first PS5 will be broken because its limit is 30th floor.
At last,  after the 32nd attempt, I can confirm both PS5s are broken.



2. What tools do you use on a day to day basis? Explain why they are important.  (10 min)

  - Github - To explore a lot of open source, issues, code writing and project management, this is most important for me.
  - VSCode - To write code
  - Stackoverflow - To explore a lot of issues and solutions.
  - Slack, Google meeting, Microsoft Teams, Zoom and the other communication tools - To meet people.
  - MailBox - To check personal & global news.
