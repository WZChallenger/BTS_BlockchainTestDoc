1. You have been given 2 unusually durable PS5â€™s. You are in an office building that is
100 stories high. Using the fewest possible number of drops from windows in your office
building, determine the highest floor you can drop a PS5 from and have it survive. For
example, they might be able to take the drop from the 30th floor, but not the 31st. You
can break both PS5s in your search. State the worst case number of drops needed and
explain how you arrived at that answer. (5 min)
